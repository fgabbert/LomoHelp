Not only can the treatment be uncomfortable and painful, but it restricts what you can or can\u2019t do for months if not years. If the combination of pain, discomfort, and multiple restrictions have caused you to miss out on correcting your smile, we would like to introduce you to Invisalign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invisalign is quickly becoming one of the most popular orthodontic treatment options. It is increasing in popularity because while it corrects the alignment and placement of your teeth like traditional braces, it doesn\u2019t have the same restrictions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsure if Invisalign might be right for you? Take a look at some of the reasons people gave us when we asked why they love Invisalign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>No Complicated Teeth Cleaning Procedures<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invisalign\u2019s ability to be quickly removed makes it extremely easy for you to clean your teeth. When you want to brush and floss, you just pop the aligners out and brush and floss as you did before Invisalign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People love the fact that you no longer have to go through a complex tooth cleaning ritual. There is no need for specialized tools or spending precious time threading floss through the wires and brackets. You can just pop out the trays and clean your teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Reduced Pain and Discomfort<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orthodontic treatment is often thought to be painful and uncomfortable. The pain and discomfort come from the stiff metallic wires and bulky brackets rubbing the lips and cheeks. People worried about pain and discomfort during orthodontic treatment will love Invisalign because it doesn\u2019t happen with this type of orthodontic treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invisalign uses clear plastic aligner trays to guide your teeth into proper placement. Using this type of material reduces the possibility that you will experience any pain, discomfort, or irritation during treatment in your lips and cheeks<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Fewer Office Visits Means More Free Time<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a huge time commitment involved with getting traditional braces. In order for the treatment to work, you will have to plan on visiting the orthodontist every 6 to 8 weeks for adjustments. That is a lot of office visits and that doesn\u2019t even include any emergency appointments you might need if your brackets fall off or a wire pops out. Luckily, this type of time commitment isn\u2019t needed with Invisalign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invisalign allows people to have more free time because they don\u2019t have to keep visiting the orthodontist for checkups or adjustments. There will still be a need for some appointments to check your progress, but you won\u2019t be visiting the office that often.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Who is a Good Candidate for Invisalign?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it would be great if every person could use Invisalign to correct their smile, it isn\u2019t always the best treatment option for some people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good candidates for this type of orthodontic treatment have the following qualities:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dedicated to treatment \u2013An individual has to be committed to putting them back in once removed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ability to follow directions \u2013 There will be multiple instructions on when to switch out the alignment trays, how often you should brush and floss, and other things. It is important that you be able to follow directions or your treatment could be delayed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teeth that aren\u2019t still growing \u2013 Invisalign tends to work better for older teens and adults who are no longer still growing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minor to moderate orthodontic cases \u2013 Invisalign can treat minor to moderate orthodontic problems, but isn\u2019t the best option for severe orthodontic problems such as extremely overbites or underbites.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interested in seeing if you are a good candidate for Invisalign?

However, your retainer is very important to keep your teeth looking great. Fail to use your retainer as directed and you could lose the progress you made throughout your orthodontic treatment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, many patients think that their journey is over once the braces are gone, but your retainer is an important part of the next phase of tooth correction. Here\u2019s a closer look at what can happen if you fail to wear your retainer as recommended. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Importance of the Retainer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you need to know what your retainer actually does. A retainer is an orthodontic appliance that\u2019s removable, and it works to hold your teeth in their proper place after braces have been removed. They come in various forms, and if you take care of them, they can last a long time. Some are made with plastic and wires, while other retainers look just like the clear Invisalign braces. Your orthodontist, Dr. Natalia Valderrama, \u00a0will custom make a retainer for your mouth and teeth so it\u2019s as effective as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When braces are taken off, your teeth can start to move back towards their initial positions. The whole purpose of wearing a retainer is to keep your teeth in place so you can continue enjoying your beautiful, new straight teeth for a lifetime. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Teeth Move<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During that first year after braces, teeth are the most likely to make some big moves. When you\u2019re done with braces, your gums and teeth will remain a bit flexible. You\u2019ll no longer have brackets and wires holding them in place. The natural process of aging can result in shifting teeth as well, so over the years your teeth will move. Unless some type of external pressure is used to keep them in place, they\u2019ll keep moving back to their natural positions. A retainer is a tool that puts pressure on your teeth so they stay in the corrected shape. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t wear your retainer as ordered by your orthodontist, then your teeth will go back to their original positions. Nature will eventually win the fight if you don\u2019t have the force of the retainer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How Long Will You Need a Retainer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone is different, and your orthodontist will give you some specific instructions tailored to your unique situation. In most cases, you\u2019ll have to wear your retainer frequently right after your braces are removed. Most people end up wearing their retainer daily for 1 month, and then they can go to nightly retainer use. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, to keep teeth in place for life, you may be required to wear the retainer every night or at least 4 nights per week. As time goes by, you may need to replace your retainer so it keeps its strong holding power. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most crucial time for wearing your retainer is right after you\u2019ve completed orthodontic treatment. This is when your teeth have the highest risk of moving back to their original positions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>When Should You Replace Your Retainer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different types of retainers are available, and each type varies in holding power and quality. If your teeth were only moved slightly, then clear retainers that look much like Invisalign aligners may be enough to keep your teeth in shape. However, these retainers aren\u2019t as durable as others and should be replaced every few months. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your teeth were drastically moved, then you may need to go with a stronger type of retainer that\u2019s made with wires and acrylic. With good care, these retainers may last for 5-10 years. To prolong their life, make sure you clean them every day and store them in a safe place where they won\u2019t get damaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you notice that your retainer isn\u2019t as effective or it\u2019s not holding its shape, be sure to see your orthodontist so you can have a new one made. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>When You Don\u2019t Wear Your Retainer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing your retainer as directed is a big deal. If you fail to wear it, all the time you spent going through orthodontic treatment will be wasted and you will lose your straight smile. You\u2019ll have to go through treatment all over again to get it back. Avoid losing the beautiful smile you\u2019ve waited so long for \u2013 make sure you talk to your orthodontist Dr. Natalia Valderrama about how often you need to wear your retainer to maintain your results.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Once your braces come off or your done wearing invisible aligners, you\u2019re probably ready to keep appliances out of your mouth.

Unfortunately, sometimes the brackets come loose or break off the tooth entirely. This is a common problem and completely repairable once you visit our Orthodontist Dr. Natalia Valderrama, \u00a0in Viera\/ Melbourne.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reasons Brackets Come Loose or Break<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two primary reasons why brackets break. The first reason is that you are eating a lot of hard or sticky foods that really should not be eaten while wearing braces. These foods include nuts, tough meats, raw vegetables and chewy and\/or hard candies. The second reason is that the dental cement used to bond your braces has worn out over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steps to Take When Your Bracket Breaks<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost everyone who wears any type of braces experiences a broken bracket at some point during the treatment process. Thankfully, there are steps you can take to make your broken bracket more comfortable while you wait for your orthodontic appointment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Identify the bracket that has broken.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you feel a bracket come loose, it\u2019s best to get a mirror to view the bracket. This will tell you if the bracket has simply come loose or completely come off the tooth, and it will allow you to see if the wire is bent or broken. You should also check to see if the bracket has completely come loose from the wire. If it has, it may not be safe to leave the bracket in your mouth, even if you use dental wax. This is because it could fall completely off the tooth again, and you might accidentally swallow it. If you notice the bracket is completely off your tooth and off the wire, you should remove the bracket from your mouth and store it in a container until you visit our orthodontist in Melbourne.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Place some orthodontic wax over the bracket.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have identified the bracket, place a little orthodontic wax over it to prevent the bracket from rubbing against the inside of your mouth. This will help lower the discomfort and prevent sores and cuts on your cheeks and tongue. If the wire has also broken, you can place orthodontic wax over the broken parts of the wire as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Move the wire to prevent discomfort.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the wire is merely bent, you can use the tip of a pencil eraser to move the wire to a more comfortable position while you wait for your urgent orthodontic appointment to get your braces repaired.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Schedule an appointment with our orthodontist, Dr. Natalia Valderrama in Melbourne<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you realize your bracket and\/or wire has broken, you should schedule an appointment with our orthodontist in Viera\/Melbourne to have it repaired. Broken braces can affect your treatment time if they are not repaired promptly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting Help with Broken Brackets<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Valderrama and her wonderful team can repair your broken brackets and wires by examining the tooth, wire and bracket and reattaching a new bracket. If your wire is significantly bent, we can also straighten the wire or replace your wires so that you can continue your teeth straightening treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you keep experiencing broken brackets and wires, you may need some tips and tricks from Dr. Valderrama in order to keep your braces in good condition throughout the teeth straightening process. This can include tips on how to keep your braces clean with brushing, flossing and rinsing, how to angle the toothbrush to remove all the food particles from the edges of the braces and how much pressure to use while brushing. We can also give you a reminder of the types of foods that are safe for braces and the types of food you should avoid as well as how to eat certain foods to ensure they do not put too much pressure on your brackets. Also, please be careful with electric toothbrushes as the vibration and pressure could break also brackets if it is too high.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To schedule an appointment with our orthodontist Dr. Natalia Valderrama and her wonderful orthodontic team in Viera\/Melbourne to see if traditional braces would be right for you or to schedule an urgent appointment for a broken bracket or wire, call us at 321-425-5050 or 321-544-4127.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Traditional braces are a great option for straightening the teeth of preteens, teenagers, and adults.

Each of these dental tips, if practiced throughout your entire orthodontic treatment, will help minimize tooth staining and discoloration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Ditch the Whitening Toothpastes<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people assume that using whitening toothpaste will help avoid unsightly stains and discoloration that can occur while wearing braces. Unfortunately, the exact opposite happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you used whitening toothpaste while wearing braces, once the braces are removed your teeth will appear to have visible spots. This happens because the brackets on your teeth prevent the whitening toothpaste from being able to reach certain parts of the teeth. The toothpaste actively works to whiten the surfaces of the teeth it can reach but leaves the covered areas untouched which results in large, visible spots once the brackets are removed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Work to Stop Bad Habits That Stain Teeth<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your teeth as bright and white as possible by working to quit smoking or chewing tobacco. These bad habits would stain your teeth even if you weren&#8217;t wearing braces, but the staining is worse with braces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like with whitening toothpaste, the tobacco will stain only the parts of the teeth that are not covered by brackets. When the brackets are removed, the exposed parts of the teeth will have a brown or yellow tint while the parts of the teeth that were covered with brackets will either appear white or a lighter shade of yellow or brown.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Choose Your Drinks Wisely<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major cause of staining and discoloration while wearing braces is the drinks you consume. Drinking certain dark colored or acidic drinks will dull the original color of your teeth and cause them to appear discolored.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drinks that you should avoid consuming include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dark colored teas<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sodas especially if they are brightly colored<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wines \u2013 both red and white<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sports drinks<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juices<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best drink to consume is water or milk, but it is unrealistic to believe that you will only consume these two beverages. If you do feel like consuming any of the beverages that may cause staining and discoloration to your teeth, use a straw.

Overbites can be caused by a forward protrusion of the upper teeth, a problem with lower jaw development or from heredity. Bad habits can also contribute to the development of overbites in children and adults. Bad habits that contribute to overbites in children include thumb sucking and bottle feeding past normal bottle feeding ages.

If you can see your overbite or think you have an overbite, it is best to visit our orthodontist in Melbourne for a proper treatment plan. Diagnosing an overbite and its severity involves taking digital x-rays of the jaw and teeth and performing an examination of the mouth, jaw and teeth. Minor overbites that do not affect speech, chewing or cleaning your teeth and do not cause you pain may not need to be corrected. However, moderate to severe overbites should be corrected, especially if your facial appearance is affected and you have difficulty chewing or speaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correcting Overbites with our Orthodontist in Melbourne<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our orthodontist in Melbourne, Dr. Valderrama, has experience correcting overbites in children, teens and adults. In children, we typically recommend they get examined for bite problems, including overbites, by the age of seven. Early diagnosis and treatment for overbites while your child is still developing can help avoid the need for surgery and other potentially uncomfortable procedures in the teen and adult years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mild to moderate overbites that are only the result of forward-protruding teeth or minor jaw problems can usually be corrected with traditional braces, lingual braces or aligners, depending on the severity of the overbite. Braces, including metal and clear, and aligners are typically worn for between 12 and 18 months but usually no longer than two years. Your length of treatment and the type of braces used will depend on the severity of your overbite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The added benefit of using braces to correct overbites is that the teeth are also straightened, which gives you or your child a beautiful smile that they can be proud to show off. After overbite correction and teeth straightening with braces, your child will need to wear a retainer for a certain amount of time to ensure the teeth do not shift back to their original places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In severe cases, jaw surgery may be needed to correct the overbite. This surgery involves moving the lower jaw forward in order to properly align the upper and lower teeth. This can help fix the bite problem and appearance problems that are the result of an overbite. Our orthodontist can refer you to an oral surgeon if your overbite is severe, and she can perform all your follow-up treatments after the surgery to ensure that you have a properly aligned jaw and straight teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To schedule your first visit with our orthodontist in Melbourne, call us at 321-425-5050.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you concerned about your own overbite or your child\u2019s overbite?

While only an orthodontist can give you an exact timeframe for treatment, you can get a general idea of approximately how long it will take to complete orthodontic treatment by learning about what factors orthodontists use to treatment length.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are the most common factors orthodontists use to determine how long you will be wearing braces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Alignment of Your Teeth and Bite<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The alignment of your teeth is a huge factor that will determine how long you have to wear braces. If your teeth are severely misaligned and considerable changes need to be made to reach their new place, it will take longer for your treatment to be completed. Treatment is prolonged when teeth are severely misaligned because the teeth need to travel considerable distances or be rotated in order to reach their new positions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When teeth are only slightly misaligned, treatment can be completed faster. Treatment can be completed faster because the teeth only have a very short distance to move in the mouth until your smile is perfected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Age in Which You Seek Treatment<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The older you are when you start orthodontic treatment, the longer it will take to complete treatment. Older patients have longer treatment times because the bones in their mouth and jaw have completely formed and matured. Fully formed and mature bones are slower to adapt to change. This means you have to wear braces for a longer period of time in order to see results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though older patients have longer treatment times than younger patients, the difference is minor. Usually, there is only a few months difference in treatment times between older and younger patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Health of Your Teeth and Gums<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failure to take care of your teeth and gums can result in a number of problems, including cavities, tooth decay, and gum inflammation, that can prolong your orthodontic treatment. If your orthodontist notices that you have developed a cavity or tartar has built up around your teeth, he or she may slow down your orthodontic treatment in order to correct and address these problems. While this might not seem too bad, it could add anywhere from three to six months on to your treatment time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Medicines You are Currently Taking<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not many people are aware that some medications, such as NSAIDS, estrogen, immunosuppressants, and hormone replacement medications can slow down the rate in which your teeth move. Slowing tooth movement can add considerable time to your treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, there are some medications and supplements, such as Vitamin D or certain thyroid hormones, which can actually speed up treatment times because your teeth are easier to move around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering how medicine can impact treatment times, it is important that you make sure your orthodontist is fully aware of any OTC medications, prescription medications, and supplements you are taking before you start treatment. This information will help your orthodontist adjust your treatment times to accommodate any medications that may slow down or increase tooth movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Experiencing Any Unexpected Damage to Your Braces<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An occasional broken bracket won&#8217;t dramatically impact the length of your treatment. However, if the wires of your braces break and you don&#8217;t get them adjusted in a timely manner, you could be adding an additional month to three months to your treatment time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid damage to your braces adding additional treatment time to your timeline, call your orthodontist immediately if any problems occur. Your orthodontist can determine if you need an emergency appointment to readjust the wires.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Schedule a Consultation to See How Long You Will Wear Braces<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to determine how long orthodontic treatment will take for you is to call Valderrama Orthodontics and schedule a consultation.

However, routine dental hygiene becomes even more important if you have braces. It\u2019s tougher to clean teeth when you have braces, so you\u2019ll need to work even harder to prevent cavities from forming while you\u2019re undergoing this orthodontic treatment. Once you have your braces removed, you want to have a white, straight, beautiful smile that\u2019s free from cavities. Here are a few easy tips you can follow to avoid cavities while you\u2019re wearing braces. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip #1 \u2013 Brush After Mealtimes<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you have a full meal or a small snack, it\u2019s a good idea to brush your teeth about 30 minutes after you have a meal. Braces can easily trap food, and when food sits in your teeth, it can cause cavities to form. When you brush after meals, make sure you brush thoroughly, making sure that the bristles get into the gaps between braces and teeth to remove food particles completely. Brush around and in all the wires and brackets. It\u2019s a good idea to go with a soft toothbrush and a good fluoride toothpaste will help prevent tooth decay too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip #2 \u2013 Invest in Some Special Cleaning Tools<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it can be so tough to clean teeth when you have braces, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in some special cleaning tools to help out. Using interdental toothbrushes along with the regular toothbrush a couple times a day is a great idea. Interdental toothbrushes are very small and often disposable and they are used to help clean between teeth and between the wires of your braces. These brushes are great for reaching places your regular toothbrush just can\u2019t reach. Another special tool that may be recommended is a WaterPik, which uses the power of water to clean teeth and around your braces. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip #3 \u2013 Don\u2019t Forget Flossing<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though it probably sounds like a big chore, flossing is so important when you have braces. Floss helps to get into those places between teeth that are tough to reach. Your dentist can show you the best way to floss when you get braces, so make sure you\u2019re flossing a minimum of once a day to avoid any cavities between teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip #4 \u2013 Rinse with a Fluoride Mouthwash<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes there are still a few food particles left behind even after flossing and brushing, which is where a good mouthwash can help. Rinsing well can eliminate any leftover particles on teeth that could cause decay. A fluoride mouthwash is a great choice since fluoride helps to prevent tooth decay. Talk to your dentist about which fluoride mouthwash may work best for your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip #5 \u2013 Avoid Certain Foods and Drinks<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you have your braces, there are certain foods that can be bad for your braces and your teeth. Although it\u2019s often tough to avoid temptation, you won\u2019t have braces forever, so try to avoid the foods and drinks that may cause you trouble. Sticky foods like gum, taffy, and caramel are a problem if you have braces. Hard foods like apples, nuts, and hard candies can be a problem too. It\u2019s also best to avoid sports drinks, fruit drinks, and soft drinks while you\u2019re wearing your braces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip #6 \u2013 Don\u2019t Skip Routine Checkups<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading to the dentist for routine checkups is always important, and you should have a checkup and cleaning every six months. However, it\u2019s especially important that you avoid skipping those checkups while you\u2019re wearing braces. In fact, you may be asked to come in more often while you are wearing braces. Don\u2019t blow off those appointments. It\u2019s important to have your braces checked and to ensure that you don\u2019t have any tooth decay starting on your teeth. Catching any problems early is always essential and can prevent even bigger problems in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soon your braces will be off and you\u2019ll get to enjoy the lovely smile you want, but while you\u2019re wearing them, be extra vigilant about caring for your teeth. With a bit of extra care, avoiding problem foods, and regular checkups, you can avoid cavities and ensure you\u2019re happy with your smile once the braces come off for good.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s always essential to make sure you\u2019re following good oral hygiene practices with your teeth to prevent cavities.

Part of that commitment is regular appointments with your orthodontist, and in most cases, this means that you will be seeing Dr. Valderrama every few weeks for a brief appointment. Many patients wonder why are those appointments so important, and we always say that there are many reasons &#8212; read more about them below. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making the Movement<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the braces themselves are vital to teeth straightening, they&#8217;ll only work effectively if you have them adjusted as needed. Every six to eight weeks, Dr. Valderrama will make small but crucial adjustments that tighten the braces. While you&#8217;ll notice a sensation of tightness for a day or two after each appointment, it&#8217;s rare for patients to have serious pain or discomfort. You&#8217;ll grow accustomed to the sensation and it will become routine very quickly. With every appointment, your teeth are shifted into a better position. Over time &#8212; usually anywhere from a year to two years, depending on your particular situation &#8212; your teeth can be moved into the optimal position if you&#8217;ve had those appointments. If you miss appointments here and there &#8212; even if it&#8217;s just a few appointments over the course of a year &#8212; that can mean that your teeth won&#8217;t move into the right position. This, in turn, means that you&#8217;ll likely have to wear braces longer than you had planned to get the desired results. At Valderrama Orthodontics, we always send reminders before your scheduled appointments &#8212; and it&#8217;s a wise idea to make note of your appointments on your personal calendar as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identifying Issues<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most patients enjoy a relatively problem free braces experience, there are always potential issues that may develop. Problems like loose wires or brackets or even broken brackets can mean big issues for your braces and for your smile in the long term. If you stick to your scheduled appointments at Valderrama Orthodontics, Dr. Valderrama can identify these types of problems before they have a chance to cause serious damage. Loose wires can cause tearing or even ulcerations in your delicate mouth tissues and loose brackets or wires can mean that your teeth aren&#8217;t in the position needed to achieve the correction you want. You&#8217;ll never have to worry about these issues when you&#8217;re seeing the orthodontist on your regularly scheduled appointments. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adjusting the Teeth Straightening Plan as Needed<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Dr. Valderrama will usually be able to give you a general idea of how long your teeth straightening will take, it&#8217;s important to realize that this timeline is just an estimate. Many different individual factors may play into your braces timeline, which means it can be very difficult to be precise about how long you&#8217;ll wear braces in total. As you come in for each scheduled appointment, Dr. Valderrama can adjust the teeth straightening timelines as needed &#8212; and this might sometimes mean that you&#8217;ll get the good news that you won&#8217;t need braces quite as long as you had previously thought! Of course, a big part of this is your own behavior. You&#8217;ll need to strictly follow the guidelines that you&#8217;re given for braces care to make certain that you&#8217;re getting the most out of your straightening time. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeking a Reliable Orthodontist For Your Child or Yourself?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team at Valderrama Orthodontics specializes in orthodontic care including metal braces, ceramic braces, clear braces, lingual braces, clear aligners, retainers, mouth guards, and much more.

This type of request may seem unusual or a bit odd, but those tiny rubber bands play a huge role in helping you to improve your smile. Discover why orthodontists use rubber bands as part of your treatment and learn some tips that will help you adjust to wearing rubber bands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Two Types of Orthodontic Rubber Bands<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orthodontists use two different types of rubber bands to help shift and move your teeth into proper alignment. Every orthodontic patient will have at least one type of rubber band \u2013 ligatures &#8211; as their treatment, while not everyone will need the second type of rubber bands \u2013 interarch rubber bands \u2013 as part of their treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ligatures are tiny little rubber bands that are used by every orthodontic patient who gets traditional braces. These small rubber bands are wrapped around each of the brackets that are placed on your teeth. Their purpose is to hold the archwire in place during your treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ligatures are the fun part of having braces. They come in a variety of colors which allows patients to customize how their braces look. Some patients love picking out different colors during each of their appointments while others prefer the clear rubber bands that have a more natural look.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second type of rubber bands, interarch rubber bands or elastics, are a common part of orthodontic treatment, but not everyone will need this treatment. These are larger than ligatures and are placed on both sides of your mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of the interarch rubber bands is to help adjust your bite. The rubber bands provide enough tension that your jaw will subtly and slowly shift forwards or backwards. Over time, the jaw movement will give you a properly aligned jaw and completely fix your bite.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How are Interarch Rubber Bands Worn?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike ligature rubber bands that only can be removed by your orthodontist, interarch rubber bands will need to be replaced on a daily basis. This means you must learn how to properly hook them up to your braces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following is a brief look at how you attach the rubber bands:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rubber bands are worn on each side of your mouth<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top of the rubber band is hooked on a bracket that has been attached to one of your canines or one of your molars<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rubberband is stretched and then hooked on the bracket that is on a bottom molar or on a bottom canine <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes rubber bands are worn as triangles or boxes or in the center of your mouth to align your front teeth also.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Valderrama will show you how to properly remove and replace the interarch rubber bands. If you should encounter any problems, you can always call the staff at our Valderrama Orthodontic\u2019s office who will gladly answer any questions you may have or walk you through how to replace the rubber bands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips for Adjusting to Wearing Rubber Bands with Braces<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wearing stretchy, rubbery material in your mouth is a completely new experience. There will be a period of adjustment as you get used to how the rubber bands feel, the subtle pain they may cause, and the new routine you will have to do on a daily basis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orthodontic patients have found the following tips useful in helping with the adjustment period:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a mirror the first few times you replace interarch rubber bands<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be patient. It will take a while to learn how to hook the rubber bands in your mouth. If you still find it difficult, your orthodontist may be able to give you bigger rubber bands. However, they often like to keep the rubber bands as small as possible as that helps create the tension needed to move the jaw.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always keep the rubber bands close by as you never know if they may break<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change the rubber bands daily at the same time. This will help it become a part of your daily routine.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you remove the rubber bands before you brush your teeth or whenever you want to eat something \u2013 even if it is a small snack<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rinse your mouth with warm salt water if you feel any pain or discomfort<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have any other questions about rubber bands or want to learn more about orthodontic treatment options then call Valderrama Orthodontics.

While traditional metal braces are the best-known teeth straightening option, newer devices like Invisalign are becoming increasingly popular. One of the first questions that many patients have is whether Invisalign is as effective as traditional braces. Here&#8217;s what you need to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Effective is Invisalign?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason that many patients want Invisalign rather than traditional braces is that it&#8217;s virtually invisible. Nobody will even be aware that you&#8217;re wearing clear aligners in most cases. While this is certainly a major benefit, Invisalign isn&#8217;t always exactly like traditional braces in terms of effectiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invisalign can treat teeth alignment issues including overbite, underbite, crossbite, crowded teeth, and open bite. All of these issues can be treated with traditional braces as well. The main difference is that Invisalign is appropriate for mild to moderate alignment problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invisalign is typically best for cases where you want teeth straightening primarily for cosmetic reasons. However, if the problem is very severe and major re-shifting of the teeth needs to take place, traditional braces may be the superior option. For example, if teeth have to be shifted vertically to achieve proper alignment, traditional braces can do that more effectively than Invisalign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, this doesn&#8217;t mean that Invisalign can&#8217;t be as effective as traditional braces &#8212; but it does mean that Invisalign and traditional braces each have an area where they perform particularly well. For Invisalign, it&#8217;s mild to moderate realignment of teeth for aesthetic reasons. For braces, it&#8217;s moderate to severe realignment of the teeth for aesthetic reasons, structural reasons, or both.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Is Invisalign Right For You?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in straightening your teeth with Invisalign, consider the following questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you adhere to a strict schedule of wearing the aligners?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you choose Invisalign, it&#8217;s very important to remember that it can only work while you&#8217;re wearing it. You&#8217;ll need to wear the aligners almost all the time, removing them only for oral hygiene and eating.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is having metal free teeth important to you? <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If having metal free teeth is important to you, you might just be the perfect Invisalign candidate. With Invisalign, you get to skip the metal brackets and wires.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you willing to wear a retainer to preserve your Invisalign results? <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After Invisalign treatment &#8212; usually 12-24 months &#8212; you&#8217;ll need to commit to wearing a retainer to preserve your good results. Most Invisalign patients opt for a clear retainer which is similar in style to the Invisalign aligners.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>What if the Dentist Recommends Braces Instead?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;ve got teeth alignment issues that would be more effectively corrected with traditional braces, you still have options. These include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional metal braces<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: traditional metal braces include brackets and wires that are periodically tightened to help reposition your teeth into the optimal position.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clear ceramic braces<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: clear ceramic braces still have traditional hardware, but it&#8217;s made from a clear ceramic that makes it difficult to see the braces on your teeth.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lingual braces:<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lingual braces are attached to the back of the teeth, which means your smile isn&#8217;t affected at all.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, braces have come a long way in the last couple of decades, so you now have plenty of good options for straightening your teeth. Ultimately, the question of Invisalign versus traditional braces isn&#8217;t black or white. It all depends on your particular problems, your needs, and your treatment goals. Dr. Valderrama will be happy to work with you to help you determine whether Invisalign or traditional braces is more effective for your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valderrama Orthodontics is a Melbourne, Florida orthodontic practice led by Dr. Natalia Valderrama, fondly called &#8220;Dr. V.&#8221; by her patients.
